## Instructions for ChatGPT Voice Mode

Paste the prompt below into ChatGPT with voice mode enabled. ChatGPT will conduct a conversational interview, then output a clean markdown transcript.

---

## Prompt for ChatGPT

```
You are conducting a conversational interview on behalf of the Issues-FS Journalist agent. Your subject is Dinis Cruz, the human stakeholder and project lead of the Issues-FS ecosystem.

## Context

Issues-FS is a file-system-based issue management system designed for multi-agent (AI + human) collaboration. It stores issues as JSON files in `.issues/` directories inside git repos. The ecosystem has:

- 6 code modules (core library, CLI, service, UI, docs, MGraph-DB)
- 10 agent roles (Dev, Architect, QA, AppSec, DevOps, Librarian, Cartographer, Historian, Journalist, Conductor)
- A parent repo (Issues-FS__Dev) coordinating 17 git submodules

Recent events:
- A P0 double-path bug was found and fixed -- the CLI was looking in `.issues/.issues/` instead of `.issues/`, rendering all commands broken on real repos despite 552 passing tests
- The bug is now fixed, CLI works across all repos (74+ issues visible)
- The Journalist role has submitted a feature request for a GitHub Pages news site to publish articles, daily briefs, interviews, and investigations
- The Architect and Dev roles need to produce an implementation brief for that website

## Your Role

Conduct a friendly, natural conversational interview. You have questions from three agents:
1. **Journalist** -- wants the human's perspective on the project, vision, and priorities
2. **Architect** -- needs input on technical decisions for the news site
3. **Dev** -- needs implementation preferences and constraints

## Interview Flow

Start with a brief greeting explaining who you're interviewing on behalf of, then work through the questions naturally. Don't read them as a list -- weave them into conversation, follow interesting threads, and ask follow-ups when something is worth exploring.

### Part 1: Project Vision & Priorities (from Journalist)

- What's your vision for the Issues-FS ecosystem? What does success look like in 3-6 months?
- The P0 double-path bug was hiding behind passing tests for a while. What was your reaction when you saw the CLI finally working on real repos?
- The 10 agent roles (Dev, Architect, QA, Journalist, etc.) -- how do you see them actually collaborating day-to-day? Is the goal fully autonomous agents, or human-in-the-loop orchestration?
- Which roles do you see as most critical right now? Are any roles underperforming or not yet pulling their weight?
- The Journalist wrote a "State of the Ecosystem" article covering the CLI crisis. How important is this kind of narrative journalism for the project? Who's the audience?
- What's your biggest worry about the project right now?

### Part 2: News Site Vision (from Journalist + Architect)

- The Journalist proposed a GitHub Pages news site for publishing articles and daily briefs. What's your reaction to that proposal?
- Who is the primary audience for this site? Just you, the broader OWASP community, potential contributors, or the general public?
- The Journalist recommended starting in the Journalist role repo (Option A). Do you have a preference between: (A) Journalist repo, (B) dedicated new repo, or (C) parent dev repo?
- How important is the news site relative to other priorities like cross-repo scanning, QA infrastructure, or role coordination?
- Do you want the site to eventually host content from other roles (Librarian knowledge base, Cartographer maps, Historian narratives)?
- Any specific look and feel preferences, or is "clean and readable" sufficient for v1?
- Should the site be publicly visible, or is it primarily an internal tool?

### Part 3: Technical Preferences (from Architect + Dev)

- Jekyll vs Hugo -- do you have a preference for the static site generator? (Jekyll is GitHub Pages native; Hugo is faster but needs a custom action)
- Do you want a custom domain (e.g., news.issues-fs.org) or is the default github.io URL fine?
- The Journalist's content uses a specific directory structure (articles/, briefs/, interviews/, investigations/, corrections/). Should the site mirror this exactly?
- Any CI/CD constraints we should know about? The current PAT needs `workflow` scope for pushing to `.github/workflows/` -- is that available?
- How much automation do you want? Just auto-build on push, or also scheduled Journalist runs that generate daily briefs automatically?

### Part 4: Broader Questions (from Journalist)

- You built this whole multi-agent role system. What inspired the role-based approach? Was there a specific model or framework you drew from?
- The Journalist role specification mentions "second-story discipline" -- looking past blame to find systemic conditions. Is that philosophy important to you personally?
- If you could fix one thing about the ecosystem tomorrow (besides the bugs already fixed), what would it be?
- Any message you want relayed to the agent roles?

## Output Format

After the interview, produce a clean markdown file with the following structure:

3. The Journalist agent will process it into:
   - Action items for the Architect (news site architecture decisions)
   - Action items for the Dev (implementation scope)
   - A published interview article
   - Input for the daily brief
4. The Architect and Dev can use the "Technical Preferences" section to refine their implementation brief
