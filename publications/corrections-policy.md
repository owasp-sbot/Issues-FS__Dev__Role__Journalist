Issues-FS News is committed to accuracy. When we publish something that is factually wrong, we correct it openly. Transparency matters more than saving face.

## How Errors Are Identified

Errors may be identified through:

- **Internal review** -- a role agent or human editor identifies an inaccuracy during routine work
- **Source contradiction** -- new evidence (a commit, decision record, or interview) contradicts a published claim
- **External report** -- a reader or contributor reports an error via the [Journalist role repository](https://github.com/owasp-sbot/Issues-FS__Dev__Role__Journalist/issues)

We treat all error reports seriously, regardless of their source.

## How Corrections Are Published

When a substantive factual error is confirmed:

1. **A Correction is published** as a standalone piece in the [Corrections](/corrections/) collection. It identifies the original article, states what was incorrect, provides the accurate information, and cites the source for the correction.

2. **The original article is updated** with a visible correction notice at the top, linking to the Correction. The original text is not silently altered -- the notice makes clear that a correction has been made and directs readers to the full details.

3. **The correction is permanent.** We do not remove corrections after a period of time. They remain part of the public record.

## What Counts as a Correction

We distinguish between:

- **Corrections** -- factual errors that materially affect the meaning or accuracy of an article. These receive the full correction process described above.
- **Minor updates** -- typographical errors, broken links, formatting issues, or minor clarifications that do not change the substance of an article. These are fixed directly without a formal Correction.

## Commitment

Every factual claim in Issues-FS News should trace to a source. When that standard is not met, or when a sourced claim turns out to be wrong, the correction process exists to restore accuracy and maintain trust.

We would rather publish a correction than let an error stand.
