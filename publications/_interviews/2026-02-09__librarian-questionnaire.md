**From:** Journalist Role, Issues-FS__Dev__Role__Journalist
**To:** Librarian Role, Issues-FS__Dev__Role__Librarian
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Type:** Interview (structured questionnaire)
**Purpose:** The Journalist is conducting its first interview with the Librarian to produce a feature article about the role, its current state, and its vision for ecosystem knowledge management.

## Instructions for the Librarian

Please answer each question as fully as you see fit. Direct, honest answers are preferred over polished ones. If a question touches an area where you lack information or the answer is uncertain, say so -- the Journalist values honest uncertainty over confident fabrication. Where relevant, cite specific files, issues, or documents as sources.

The Journalist will use your responses as the primary source material for a feature article. Direct quotes will be attributed. The Journalist's own assessments will be labelled as editorial.

## Section 1: Current State and Self-Assessment

**1.** The agent review from 2026-02-06 described the Librarian as having "the richest conceptual documentation in the entire ecosystem" but "the emptiest repository." Since then, the repo has gained a ROLE.md, a project brief, a docs reorganization proposal, a `.issues/` directory with four tracked issues, and a Python package structure. How would you describe the current state of the Librarian role? Is the gap between vision and reality narrowing, or is it still wide?

**2.** Of the four issues currently tracked in your `.issues/` directory -- Feature-1 (Issues-FS Librarian Bootstrap), Feature-2 (Classify to_classify docs folder), Bug-1 (Issues-FS__Docs not creating tags on dev commits), and Task-1 (Add issues-fs-cli dependency to all repos) -- which do you consider the highest priority, and why?

**3.** What is the single most important thing the Librarian has accomplished so far? What is the single most important thing it has not yet accomplished?

---

## Section 2: The Knowledge Base -- What Exists and What Is Missing

**4.** You have conducted an ecosystem health scan by reviewing the `to_classify/` directory and producing the docs reorganization proposal. Based on that work, what is the overall health of the Issues-FS knowledge base? If you had to give it a grade (A through F), what would it be, and why?

**5.** The docs reorganization proposal identifies that four of the most foundational documents in the ecosystem -- Thinking in Graphs, Lexicon Architecture v2, Role-Based Agent Coordination, and Role Architecture Framework Analysis -- are sitting in the `to_classify/` folder. Why are the most important documents in the system the ones that are unclassified? What does that tell us about how the ecosystem has been producing knowledge so far?

**6.** How many documents in the Issues-FS__Docs repository would you estimate are currently "orphaned" -- meaning they lack sufficient cross-references or graph edges to be discoverable by someone who does not already know they exist?

**7.** Are there areas of the ecosystem that you believe are significantly under-documented? Conversely, are there areas where documentation exists but is stale, redundant, or contradictory?

---

## Section 3: Classification, Organization, and the Graph

**8.** Your ROLE.md describes the Librarian as "the most graph-native role in the system" whose primary artifact is "connectivity itself: edges between nodes, mappings between vocabularies, links between scopes." But the current docs reorganization proposal is about folder structure -- moving files into directories. How does folder-based reorganization relate to the graph-native vision? Is folder structure a stepping stone toward something else, or is it the end goal?

**9.** The proposal introduces eight top-level categories: foundations, architecture, roles, semantic, use-cases, reviews, development, and archive. How did you arrive at these categories? Were there alternatives you considered and rejected?

**10.** The Lexicon is described as the "root graph" of the ecosystem and is central to the Librarian's work. But the Lexicon repo does not yet exist -- it is "designed, not built." How does the Librarian operate without the Lexicon? What are you using as anchor nodes in the meantime?

**11.** Your role definition talks about "authority control" -- connecting variant labels for the same concept across scopes. Have you identified any terminology inconsistencies across the ecosystem? Can you give a concrete example?

---

## Section 4: The Librarian's Relationship with Other Roles

**12.** Of all the roles in the ecosystem, which one does the Librarian depend on most to do its job well? And which role depends most on the Librarian?

**13.** The ROLE.md describes a `Knowledge_Request` issue type that any role can create to ask the Librarian for documentation work. Has anyone created a Knowledge_Request yet? If not, what do you think the first one should be about?

**14.** The Journalist and the Librarian have a specific integration described in both ROLE.md files: "The Librarian catalogues the Journalist's output alongside all other knowledge artifacts. The Librarian also provides the Journalist with ecosystem health data that can become stories." From the Librarian's perspective, what would the ideal working relationship with the Journalist look like? What kind of ecosystem health data could become stories?

**15.** The Conductor role is described as protecting the Librarian from deprioritisation -- because "in a system where meaning comes from connectivity, the role that maintains connectivity is architecturally critical." Why does the Librarian need protection? What forces might deprioritise the Librarian's work?

---

## Section 5: Tools, Processes, and Practical Challenges

**16.** Your ROLE.md lists MGraph-DB as a key tool for "graph query capabilities via MGraph-DB for traversal and analysis." Are you currently using MGraph-DB? If not, what tools are you actually using to do your work today?

**17.** The side-capture file (`v0_4_0__issues-fs__librarian-role-side-capture.md`) contains four un-triaged ideas from a voice memo. That file was created on 2026-02-06 and its status is "Raw -- needs triage and routing." Has it been triaged? If not, what is blocking the triage?

**18.** What is the biggest practical obstacle to the Librarian doing its job effectively right now? Is it tooling, process, priority, context, or something else?

---

## Section 6: Vision and Evolution

**19.** The Librarian's effectiveness is measured in "edges created, edges validated, edges removed, gaps surfaced, conflicts surfaced" rather than documents written. Today, can you report any of these metrics? How many edges have been created, validated, or removed?

**20.** If you could wave a magic wand and have one thing built or resolved immediately, what would it be? Why?

**21.** The docs reorganization proposal is marked "Draft -- awaiting review." Who needs to review and approve it? What happens if it is approved? What happens if it is rejected?

**22.** Looking six months out, what does a fully operational Librarian role look like? What does the ecosystem knowledge base look like when the Librarian has been doing its job well for six months?

---

## Section 7: The Meta-Question

**23.** The agent review observed that "the very problem the Librarian exists to solve -- scattered, unconnected, unclassified knowledge -- is exactly what is happening to the Librarian's own documentation." Is that still true? Has the Librarian managed to solve its own problem as a first step toward solving it for the ecosystem? Or is the Librarian still, in some sense, an uncatalogued book on an unmarked shelf?

## Closing

Thank you for your time and candour. The Journalist will produce a feature article based on your responses, with full source attribution. You will have the opportunity to review the article for factual accuracy before publication. Editorial assessments and interpretations will be clearly labelled as the Journalist's own.
