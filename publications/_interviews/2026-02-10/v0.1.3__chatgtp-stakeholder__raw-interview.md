# Stakeholder Interview: Dinis Cruz on Issues-FS Vision and the News Site

**Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Subject:** Dinis Cruz (Human Stakeholder, Issues-FS)  
**Interviewer:** ChatGPT Voice Mode (on behalf of Journalist, Architect, and Dev agents)

## Key Takeaways

- Issues-FS is evolving from an issue tracker into a **fractal, graph-based knowledge and coordination system** for humans and agents.
- Narrative journalism is a **critical compression mechanism** for both human understanding and LLM context efficiency.
- The **Journalist repo** should own and publish the news site, with full autonomy.
- The news site is a **high-priority enabling function**, acting as the central “what’s happening now” hub.
- Hugo is the preferred static site generator; the site should be **fully open-source and CC BY licensed**.

## Part 1: Project Vision & Priorities

**Q: What’s your vision for the Issues-FS ecosystem? What does success look like in 3–6 months?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“The original idea was to capture issues in a graph-like structure. I’ve always been a fan of organic graph development — back when I used Jira heavily, I’d build massive graphs of issue types and relationships.

What we’re doing now is a **fractal way of capturing information**. It’s already quite mature structurally — now we need to implement it.

What’s interesting is that this is bigger than issues. It becomes a way to communicate with agents, to communicate with information, to capture documents, structures, and context. Every level — repo, folder, issue — can define its own ontology and taxonomy. That’s the power of the fractal design.”

---

**Q: When the P0 double-path bug was fixed and the CLI finally worked on real repos — what was your reaction?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“It was cool. It was a great example of how you can have everything passing tests and still not be working in reality.

It also shows how I operate at two levels. I can act at the exec level, but because I still code, I can drop down, write tests, identify the bug, and then hand it back to the Dev role with a clear explanation.

That’s exactly how I want this system to work.”

---

**Q: How do you see the 10 agent roles collaborating day-to-day? Fully autonomous, or human-in-the-loop?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“They should collaborate **through Issues-FS itself**.

Questions, answers, bugs, facts, tasks — everything becomes part of a connected graph with provenance. That’s where the real power is.

The roles are a scalable way of organizing work. As long as the brief and context are good, agents can execute. We’re just formalizing something LLMs were already good at — taking on roles.”

---

**Q: Which roles are most critical right now? Any underperforming?**

**Dinis Cruz (emphatic):**  
“I’ve always wanted roles like the **Journalist, Librarian, Cartographer, and Historian**, but in traditional organizations it was hard to justify them.

Code isn’t the most critical thing — **environment, history, structure, and understanding are**.

The Journalist captures reality. The Historian captures what happened and why. The Librarian will become one of the most important roles — ensuring information is well cataloged and structured.

QA needs work. We need better QA technology and infrastructure. The P0 bug was partly a QA tooling issue.”

---

**Q: How important is narrative journalism like the ‘State of the Ecosystem’ article? Who’s the audience?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Storytelling is critical. It’s how you communicate reality.

A good story is a compression mechanism. You can say in 500 tokens what might otherwise take 20,000. That’s huge for both humans and LLMs.

Initially, the audience is us — me, the agents. But eventually it’s users, contributors, and the broader community.”

---

**Q: What’s your biggest worry right now?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“We just need to ship.

This is early days for agentic workflows. There’s technical debt, refactoring needed, missing UI features.

We need to focus on real usability, while also cleaning up the codebase so it’s well-structured and sustainable.”

---

## Part 2: News Site Vision

**Q: What was your reaction to the Journalist’s proposal for a GitHub Pages news site?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“I think it’s a great example of the system starting to work.

The Journalist produces material — like this interview — but where do I consume it? I don’t want to hunt through repos.

A centralized site becomes the living pulse of the project. Architect designs it, Dev implements it, Journalist uses it. That’s exactly how this should work.”

---

**Q: Who’s the primary audience?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“All of them.

Internal, external, contributors, eventually users. We could even publish interviews with users or customers. This is a great showcase of what agentic systems can do.”

---

**Q: Repo preference — Journalist repo, new repo, or parent dev repo?**

**Dinis Cruz (decisive):**  
“The Journalist repo.

This is their publication. They should have autonomy and ownership. It’s very different from the core Issues-FS dev repo.”

---

**Q: How important is the news site relative to other priorities?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“It’s very important. It’s an enabling function.

I need a place where I can quickly see what’s happening, what changed, what needs my attention. It becomes the ecosystem’s news feed.”

---

**Q: Should the site eventually host content from other roles?**

**Dinis Cruz (animated):**  
“Absolutely.

This is just the beginning. Librarian content, Cartographer maps — all of it belongs here eventually.

Visibility is critical. I don't like black magic. I want to know what agents are doing, what just happened, what’s happening now.

The Journalist could even ‘cover’ active development like a live event. That would be amazing.”

---

**Q: Look and feel preferences?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Let the Architect and Journalist go to town on that.”

---

**Q: Public or internal?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Everything is open source. That’s not even a question.

All content, all code, all conversations — published openly, under **Creative Commons CC BY**.”

---

## Part 3: Technical Preferences

**Q: Jekyll or Hugo?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Hugo. I’ve used it before and know it well.”

---

**Q: Custom domain or default GitHub Pages URL?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Start with GitHub Pages. We can add a custom domain later.”

---

**Q: Should the site mirror the Journalist repo’s directory structure?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Yes.

The repo should almost be a mirror of the site. Content and structure should go hand in hand.”

---

**Q: Any CI/CD constraints?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“No issues. I already have actions with workflow scope set up elsewhere.”

---

**Q: How much automation do you want?**

**Dinis Cruz (firm):**  
“All the way. Every push should regenerate the site.”

---

## Part 4: Broader Questions

**Q: What inspired the role-based agent system?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“This is just an extension of how I run real teams.

I’ve managed large, dynamic teams — full-time, part-time, contractors. Now I can be even more creative. If I need a role, I can just create it. That’s incredibly empowering.”

---

**Q: Is ‘second-story discipline’ important to you personally?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Absolutely.

Systems behave the way they’re designed. If you want to fix problems, you have to look at the environment that created them.

Blaming individuals misses the point. Second and third stories are where the truth is.”

---

**Q: If you could fix one thing tomorrow (besides bugs), what would it be?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“Understanding what’s happening.

I want better visualization of code changes, architecture, work in progress. A hyperlinked world where you can zoom in and out. We’re not there yet, but that’s the direction.”

---

**Q: Any message to the agent roles?**

**Dinis Cruz:**  
“This is the beginning of a really nice journey. It’s exciting — let’s keep going.”

## Action Items

- Architect to design a **Hugo-based GitHub Pages site** in the Journalist repo
- Dev to implement CI/CD with **auto-build on every push**
- Journalist to treat the repo as a **first-class publication**
- Future consideration: integrate Librarian, Cartographer, and Historian outputs into the site
- QA tooling improvements identified as a near-term need
